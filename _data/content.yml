  text: "<p>Greetings!  I'm Obreja Adrian, a web designer based in the European Union, driven by a profound passion for cutting-edge technologies. My expertise lies in crafting captivating front-end experiences, where I relish the process of transforming design concepts into vibrant, functional websites. Witnessing pixels spring to life brings me immense satisfaction.<br>
  Additionally, my affection for Drupal holds a special place in my professional journey. I am committed to adhering to three fundamental principles: maintaining clean and minimalist web design, producing impeccable code, and ensuring swift website loading times.<br>
  To stay abreast of the ever-evolving technology landscape, I make it a part of my daily routine to immerse myself in the industry. This involves devouring technical blogs, devouring books, and absorbing the latest insights from podcasts.</p>"
